Changes Made: The changes that were made in order to be able to handle forwarding and stalls included updating the forading logic for registers rs and rt, and completed the 
the stalling logic for register. We implmented forwarding for 1 stage later from EX/MEM to ID/EX and 2 stages later from MEM/WB to ID/EX. We also implmented forwarding signals to 
have forwardization, which included rs_ex and rt_ex. For stalling we implmented stall signals for load use hazards and dependency detection for rt, We also makde sure to handle 
branch detection and making sure to resolve it in the ID stage.
